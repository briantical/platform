# Project Deliverables

## Improvements

- Containerize the applications using `docker` and `docker-compose`.
- Separate the applications into different repositories to support different teams working concurrently
- Implement the unit tests and integration tests.
- Define the available times and open roles from the backend and create the corresponding endpoint to fetch them.
- Perform further UI/UX improvements. The web application is already responsive because of the bootstrap though the designs could be improved.
- Perform stricter validation of the forms.
- Create authentication of the server requests.
- Update the models to create a separate model for the Role and create a relation between the the Role and Application.
- Use the semantic version with the commit messages.
- Notify the user of successfully submission like using email.
- Use swagger to document the API endpoints.

## Assumptions

- Every user has a unique phone number.

## Total Time Spent

Basing on the time of my first commit `Mon Jun 17 08:55:03 2024 +0300`, ideally I have spent about 21 hours on the implementation. This is a summation of all the time with the last 72 hours.
